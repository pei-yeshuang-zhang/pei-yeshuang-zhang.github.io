<div class="text-container">
  <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
  <p>When identifying my values, I struggled a lot because I feel like my values are continually changing over time as life is fluid, not rigid, and these values change based on our experiences; each person's values are unique to their journey. But eventually, I picked integrity, compassion, open-mindedness, diversity and equity as some core values that have always played an important role throughout my life.</p>
  <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>
  <p>I worked as a kitchen designer in both China and New Zealand for over six years, one of the ethical dilemmas I often faced in my work was, should I sell my client a product that I know is good enough for them, though I know I could get higher commission by selling them a more expensive alternative? I chose to keep my integrity every time. Maybe I was silly and naive, hard to say. But I know in myself that I will feel terrible afterward if I choose to sell an expensive but unnecessary product to a client who trusted me because that does not align with my values.</p>
  <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
  <p>I believe we all have multiple identities: as a person who was born and raised in mainland China, my values are shaped profoundly by our culture as integrity and compassion are the most frequently mentioned core values in my country; as a person who identifies herself as queer, I see open-mindedness and diversity as my fundamental beliefs; as a new immigrant and a member of an ethnic minority, I value equity, which is about fairness and social justice, I believe people should not be treated differently because of their gender, age, ethnic groups, religious beliefs and disabilities, everyone should have equitable opportunities to develop knowledge and skills.</p>
  <h3>Strengths and limitations in learning and career development.</h3>
  <p>I would say I am a dedicated, disciplined, compassionate person with practical insight. Time management is crucial during intensive learning and work, I believe my strength in discipline could help me to develop good time management and productivity. As for limitations, I find myself lacking in confidence when speaking in front of a group of people, and I can be reserved when dealing with people I am not familiar with yet.</p>
  <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
  <p>I remember it was my second year as a kitchen designer, me and a couple of designers were assigned to a new project. By that time, I hadn't finished my last project, so the workload was a bit overwhelming for me. One day, I overheard one of the designers in our team complaining about my delay on several tasks and got even more stressed. I approached her, explained my situation, listened patiently to what she had to say, and expressed my apologies for the delays. The conversation went smoothly, and we found some common ground to work toward resolution. In the future, if I were to face this kind of situation again, I would explain my situation to other colleges in advance to avoid any misunderstandings.</p>
