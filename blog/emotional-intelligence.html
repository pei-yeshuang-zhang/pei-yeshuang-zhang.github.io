  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
  <p>Emotional Intelligence is the quality that enables us to confront with patience, insight and imagination the many problems that we face in our affective relationship with ourselves and with other people.</p>
  <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>

  <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
  <p>In my own experience, it’s not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life.  </p> 
  <p>Intellectual ability isn’t enough on its own to achieve success in life. Yes, your IQ can help you get into college, but it’s your EQ that will help you manage the stress and emotions when facing your final exams. </p>
  <p>Emotional intelligence affects your performance at school or work, your physical and mental health and even your relationships. You would be more efficient and able to create more productive relationships around yourself if you improve your EQ. Emotional Intelligence is vital because it is inherent to who we are, and it affects every aspect of our lives.</p>
