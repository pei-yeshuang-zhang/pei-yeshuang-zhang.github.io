    <p>
      I am a web developer who has over 6 years of working experience in the interior and furniture design sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am now seeking a role to explore my passion in web development. I enjoy learning new things and am unafraid of challenges; tech industry is a fast-growing industry, while constant change may feel exhausting to some, I find it quite exhilarating, thus I believe I have the potential to exceed expectations of the role quickly. In addition to that, my prior experience as an interior designer has provided me with unique soft skills that I can apply to this role, such as communication, teamwork, collaboration, and problem-solving. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideally I would like to get involved in programmes that aim to deliver a positive impact and lasting changes in the world around us, to help build an equitable, inclusive and sustainable future.
