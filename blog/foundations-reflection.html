      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          1. The fact that how little I paid attention to myself, how hard it is to be honest and true to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I found myself able to pull myself together in emotionally tough times and focus on accomplishing most of my study plans on daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. I realized that I have a fixed mindset when encountering obstacles and can easily get frustrated or lead to self-criticism.
        </p>

      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
          Your values determine who you are, and they will naturally lead you work hard towards what you believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy is crucial when it comes to work with others. In programming, you have to work in a team, your code will be reviewed by peers and you will need to give and receive feedbacks, empathy helps to understand, to relate, to respect other’s feelings and different ways of doing things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being self-aware gives you the ability to take a step back and observe yourself, realize how you are mentally and physically, and identify your strengths and weaknesses, all of which will guide you to better learning.
        </p>

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          This was the first time I've ever heard of fixed and growth mindset, I realized that I have a fixed mindset in some situations as mentioned above, but it was great to know I can train myself to shift to a growth mindset which I believe is very helpful in all aspects of one's life. 
        </p>

      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          For me the most challenging part of core learning was the topic of values and identities. I've never explored myself that deep and I found it hard to make a “summary” of my values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another aspect that particularly challenging for me was that I found it hard to articulate my research and thoughts in writing as English is not my first language. 
        </p>

      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          1. The core content helps students to cope with the stress that comes along with the intensive learning journey, thus giving us a better learning outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As we are often told, when looking for a job your core competency is not necessarily your coding skills, but your soft skills, such as how you interact with others and what you can bring to the team.
        </p>

      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
          No, actually I took it as a good opportunity to dive into self-exploration which has been neglected by myself for a very long time. And some of the contents were very interesting and inspiring like the neuroplasticity and mindset, I learned a lot from it and it gave me the confidence to re-build myself to be a better person.
