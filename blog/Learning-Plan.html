  <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned in foundation learning plan, I wish to be able to combine my art/design background and my coding knowledge together one day.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I would like to be able to work remotely. I also want to have the chance to participate in projects that help make the world a better place, such as projects that focus on the rights of women and LGBTQ people, poverty, and environmental issues. 
      </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        I think my idea of my biggest strengths and limitations hasn't changed much throughout Foundations. However, I found a new strength of me which was mentioned in <a href="/blog/foundations-reflection.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">Foundation Reflection</a> was my ability to adjust myself and stay focused on my work during hard times. 
      </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>
        I've never been very comfortable with fully expressing myself in front of others as an introvert, and can be a bit reserved when dealing with people I don't familiar with. And as a less confident non-native speaker, public speaking is also a big challenge for me. 
      </p>
    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>
        First I'd like to develop my communication skills and even my initiative when interacting with others and working within groups, as I understand how important teamwork is. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, I'd like to get comfortable with giving and receiving feedback as this is something I'm not very good at, I always find it a bit intimidating when it comes to giving others feedback, especially when this person is more skilled than me.
      </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned in my foundation learning plan, I expect them to be friendly, understanding and patient. In addition to that, I'd like to receive feedback regarding both the tech and core learning from the team as I think it helps me to find out the right direction and improve my capability.
      </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        I expect myself to be fully engaged in Bootcamp and enjoy the learning journey. I expect to push myself to the limits and I want to be a better version of myself, both in terms of tech and soft skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will not hesitate to seek help from peers or our facilitators if I get stuck for too long. Time management has rarely been an issue in my learning experience, and I am confident that I can manage it well. Regarding work with others, I'll use this quote that I've quoted before and always keep it in mind: "Listen with curiosity, speak with candor, and act with integrity.".
      </p>

  <h2>foundation Learning Plan</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        First to get a web developer position at a company that aligns with my values, then I wish to be able to combine my art/design background and my coding knowledge together one day. I would love to try UI/UX design in the future.
      </p>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
      <p>
        I see myself as a dedicated, disciplined, compassionate individual. Time management is crucial during intensive learning, I believe  my strength in discipline could help me to develop good time management and productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I can get overly self-critical and that can lead to self-doubting.
      </p>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
        I would like to grow my confidence in general. For example, to become more comfortable when working with a group of people that I'm not familiar with yet; become a confident public speaker, etc.
      </p>
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
      <p>
        Since the beginning of the foundation, I have started studying around 9 am every day and have been able to keep a high concentration level for a reasonably long duration each day. I will be respectful and friendly to others, “Listen with curiosity, speak with candor, and act with integrity.”.
      </p>
    <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h3>
      <p>
        I will be trying to approach our facilitators and others in the group for support or share with people I trust so they can comfort me in any way.
      </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
      <p>
        I tend to solve problems by myself using google and youtube, but if I get stuck for too long, I will not hesitate to seek help from the Discord group or our facilitators.
      </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitators to be friendly and understanding, and also be very patient so they won't get too annoyed when I ask some not-that-smart questions.
      </p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p>
        I have planned to study full time during weekdays, just going to keep some of my routines during the weekend, like some exercise or outdoor activities.
