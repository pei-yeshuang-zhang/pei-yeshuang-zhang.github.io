  <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  <p>First to get a web developer position at a company that aligns with my values, then I wish to be able to combine my art/design background and my coding knowledge together one day. I would love to try UI/UX design in th future.</p>
  <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h2>
  <p>I see myself as a dedicated, disciplined, compassionate individual. Time management is crucial during intensive learning, I believe my strength in discipline could help me to develop good time management and productivity.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I can get overly self-critical and that can lead to self-doubting.</p>
  <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p>I would like to grow my confidence in general. For example, to become more comfortable when working with a group of people that I'm not familiar with yet; become a confident public speaker, etc.</p>
  <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
  <p>Since the beginning of the foundation, I have started studying around 9 am every day and have been able to keep a high concentration level for a reasonably long duration each day. I will be respectful and friendly to others, “Listen with curiosity, speak with candor, and act with integrity.”.</p>
  <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h2>
  <p>I will be trying to approach our facilitators and others in the group for support or share with people I trust so they can comfort me in any way.</p>
  <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
  <p>I tend to solve problems by myself using google and youtube, but if I get stuck for too long, I will not hesitate to seek help from the Discord group or our facilitators.</p>
  <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
  <p>I expect the facilitators to be friendly and understanding, and also be very patient so they won't get too annoyed when I ask some not-that-smart questions.</p>
  <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
  <p>I have planned to study full time during weekdays, just going to keep some of my routines during the weekend, like some exercise or outdoor activities.</p>
