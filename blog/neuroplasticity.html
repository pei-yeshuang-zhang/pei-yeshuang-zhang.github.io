      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity allows people to face difficulties and challenges with a positive and optimistic attitude, allowing us to believe that we can achieve more with practice and effort, rather than relying solely on their natural intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit by reminding myself that every time I get stuck, I'm creating new connections between my neurons, I'm rewriting my brain to adapt to new circumstances. The more difficulties I overcome, the more significant changes are being made in my brain, which will lead to greater success.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many ways to increase our neuroplasticity, for example, learn something new, maybe a new language, a new sport, a new instrument, even cook some new food. Every new experience has the potential to enhance your brain's ability to change. Exercise also plays an important role, according to a 2018 literature review, activity is beneficial for many different regions of the brain and affects various aspects of cognitive function, including memory and learning. And of course, don't forget to get enough rest! A lack of sleep seems to contribute to a decrease in neurogenesis, the process that allows the brain to repair and change.

      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is a mindset that one's innate skills, talents, and abilities can be developed and improved with determination. According to psychologist Carol Dweck, with a growth mindset, individuals may achieve more than others because they are worrying less about seeming smart or talented and putting more of their energy into learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was all quite surprising for me during the research because this is the first time I have ever heard of growth and fixed mindsets. As my research progressed, I learned more and more about the differences between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset and realized that I have a fixed mindset in many aspects.

          But since I have the awareness now, I believe I'm on the right track.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding integrating a growth mindset into my learning journey, I especially want to work on the following two aspects: The first one is to try to view failure in a different light; that means to see failure as an opportunity to learn from my experiences and apply what I have learned next time around, instead of being self-critical or feeling unworthy. The second is to acknowledge and embrace my imperfections; don't hide from weaknesses.
